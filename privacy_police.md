None of this information can personally identify specific [[ "user"]] to this [[ "app"]]. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes.


## Cookies

Where necessary, this [[ "app"]] uses cookies to store information about a visitor’s preferences and history in order to better serve the [["user"]] and/or present the [[ "user"]] with customized content.


## Advertisement and Other Third Parties

Advertising partners and other third parties may use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track [["user"]] activities on this [["app"]] in order to display advertisements and other useful information. Such tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and is subject to their own privacy policies. This [["app"]] has no access or control over these cookies, scripts and/or web beacons that may be used by third parties.

## Information we collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so—for example, to provide our services, to communicate with you, or to make our app better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources.

Information You Provide to Us
Account Information: To create an account, you must provide your email address or use a third-party service. Your email address is necessary for account recovery, and it helps us communicate with you.

Profile Information: You may choose to provide profile information like a photo, display name, and other details to personalize your account.

Payment Information: To make a purchase, you may need to provide payment information, such as your credit card or other payment details. We use a third-party service to process payments securely.

Automatically Collected Information
Log Data: When you use our services, our servers automatically record information ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you're using it.

Device Information: We may collect information about the device you're using the app on, including the type of device, operating system, settings, and unique device identifiers.

## How we use the information
We use the information we collect to provide our services, improve them, and to keep our app safe and secure.

## Links to Third Party Websites

[["I"]] have included links on this [["app"]] for your use and reference. [["I"]] are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from [["my"]] own.


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to [["me"]], but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While [["I"]] strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, [["I"]] cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of [[Date]] and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

[["I"]] reserve the right to update or change [[ "my"]] Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If [["I"]] make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, [[ "I"]] will notify you either through the email address you have provided [["me"]], or by placing a prominent notice on [["app"]].


## Contact Information

For any questions or concerns regarding the privacy policy, please send [["me"]] an email to [[osamagamil@0samaahmed.com]].
